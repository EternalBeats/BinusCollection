# BinusCollection

This is just some stuff I did to make my life easier (just tired of logging in to binusmaya for checking somestuff and takes minutes to load the page for some other stuff that we don't really needs). Feel free to use it if you want :)

## Currently

|Name|Functionality|
|---|---|
|creds.py|Your Binus credential|
|AssignmentScrap.py|Take all the assignment in your current semester and download the file|
|ClassScrap.py|Take all your class schedule from myclass|
|binusUtil.py|Login and GetCourseData|
|autoForum.py|Auto reply unreplied forum|

## What's next?

- probably some way to upload your assignment without opening binusmaya
